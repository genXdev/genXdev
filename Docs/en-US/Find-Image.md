# Find-Image

> **Module:** GenXdev.AI.Queries | **Type:** Function | **Aliases:** `findimages`, `li`

## Synopsis

> Searches for image files and metadata in specified directories with filtering
capabilities and optional browser-based gallery display.

## Description

Searches for image files (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, webp, tiff, tif) in the
specified directory and its subdirectories. For each image, checks associated
description.json,
keywords.json, people.json, and objects.json files for metadata. Can filter
images based on keyword matches, people recognition, and object detection, then
return the results as objects. Use -ShowInBrowser to display results in a
browser-based masonry layout.

Parameter Logic:
- Within each parameter type (Keywords, People, Objects, etc.): Uses OR logic
  Example: -Keywords "cat","dog" finds images with EITHER cat OR dog
- Between different parameter types: Uses AND logic
  Example: -Keywords "cat" -People "John" finds images with cat AND John
- EXIF range parameters: Provide [min, max] values for filtering ranges
- String parameters: Support wildcard matching with * and ?

The function searches through image directories and examines alternate data
streams containing metadata in JSON format. It can match keywords using wildcard
patterns, filter for specific people, and search for detected objects. By
default, returns image data objects. Use -ShowInBrowser to display in a web
browser.
