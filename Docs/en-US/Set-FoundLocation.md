## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Pipeline | Position | Default | Description |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| `-Name` | String | ✅ | — | 0 | — | File name or pattern to search for. 🌐 *Supports wildcards* |
| `-InputObject` | Object | ✅ | ✅ (ByValue, ByPropertyName) | Named | — | File name or pattern to search for from pipeline input. Default is '*' *(Parameter set: )* 🌐 *Supports wildcards* |
| `-Content` | String[] | — | — | 1 | `@(".*")` | Regular expression pattern to search within file contents *(Parameter set: )* 🌐 *Supports wildcards* |
| `-Category` | String[] | — | — | Named | — | Only output files belonging to selected categories |
| `-MaxDegreeOfParallelism` | Int32 | — | — | Named | `0` | Maximum degree of parallelism for directory tasks |
| `-TimeoutSeconds` | Int32 | — | — | Named | — | Optional: cancellation timeout in seconds |
| `-AllDrives` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | Search across all available drives |
| `-File` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | Search for filenames only and change to folder of first found file |
| `-DirectoriesAndFiles` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | Include filename matching and change to folder of first found file |
| `-IncludeAlternateFileStreams` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | Include alternate data streams in search results |
| `-NoRecurse` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | Do not recurse into subdirectories |
| `-FollowSymlinkAndJunctions` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | Follow symlinks and junctions during directory traversal |
| `-IncludeOpticalDiskDrives` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | Include optical disk drives |
| `-SearchDrives` | String[] | — | — | Named | `@()` | Optional: search specific drives |
| `-DriveLetter` | Char[] | — | — | Named | `@()` | Optional: search specific drives |
| `-Root` | String[] | — | — | Named | `@()` | Optional: search specific base folders combined with provided Names |
| `-IncludeNonTextFileMatching` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | Include non-text files (binaries, images, etc.) when searching file contents |
| `-CaseNameMatching` | IO.MatchCasing | — | — | Named | `(
            [System.IO.MatchCasing]::PlatformDefault)` | Gets or sets the case-sensitivity for files and directories |
| `-SearchADSContent` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | When set, performs content search within alternate data streams (ADS). When not set, outputs ADS file info without searching their content. |
| `-MaxRecursionDepth` | Int32 | — | — | Named | `0` | Maximum recursion depth for directory traversal. 0 means unlimited. |
| `-MaxFileSize` | Int64 | — | — | Named | `0` | Maximum file size in bytes to include in results. 0 means unlimited. |
| `-MinFileSize` | Int64 | — | — | Named | `0` | Minimum file size in bytes to include in results. 0 means no minimum. |
| `-ModifiedAfter` | DateTime | — | — | Named | — | Only include files modified after this date/time (UTC). |
| `-ModifiedBefore` | DateTime | — | — | Named | — | Only include files modified before this date/time (UTC). |
| `-AttributesToSkip` | IO.FileAttributes | — | — | Named | `(
            [System.IO.FileAttributes]::System)` | File attributes to skip (e.g., System, Hidden or None). |
| `-Exclude` | String[] | — | — | Named | `@("*\\.git\\*")` | Exclude files or directories matching these wildcard patterns (e.g., *.tmp, *\\bin\\*). |
| `-CaseSensitive` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | Indicates that the cmdlet matches are case-sensitive. By default, matches aren't case-sensitive. *(Parameter set: )* |
| `-Culture` | String | — | — | Named | — | Specifies a culture name to match the specified pattern. The Culture parameter must be used with the SimpleMatch parameter. The default behavior uses the culture of the current PowerShell runspace (session). *(Parameter set: )* |
| `-Encoding` | String | — | — | Named | `"UTF8NoBOM"` | Specifies the type of encoding for the target file. The default value is utf8NoBOM. *(Parameter set: )* |
| `-NotMatch` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | The NotMatch parameter finds text that doesn't match the specified pattern. *(Parameter set: )* |
| `-SimpleMatch` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | Indicates that the cmdlet uses a simple match rather than a regular expression match. In a simple match, Select-String searches the input for the text in the Pattern parameter. It doesn't interpret the value of the Pattern parameter as a regular expression statement. *(Parameter set: )* |
| `-Push` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | Use Push-Location instead of Set-Location and push the location onto the location stack |
| `-ExactMatch` | SwitchParameter | — | — | Named | — | When set, only exact name matches are considered. By default, wildcard matching is used unless the Name contains wildcard characters. |
