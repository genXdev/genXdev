    begin {

        Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Write-Verbose 'Initiating speech cancellation request'
    }


    process {

        try {
            if ($PSCmdlet.ShouldProcess('Text-to-speech output', 'Stop')) {
                # cancel all pending standard speech operations
                $null = [GenXdev.Helpers.Misc]::Speech.SpeakAsyncCancelAll()

                # cancel all pending customized speech operations
                $null = [GenXdev.Helpers.Misc]::SpeechCustomized.SpeakAsyncCancelAll()

                Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Write-Verbose 'Successfully cancelled all speech operations'
            }
        }
        catch {
            # silently handle any speech cancellation errors
            Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Write-Verbose 'Error occurred while attempting to cancel speech'
        }
